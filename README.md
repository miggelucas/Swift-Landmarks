# Swift-Landmarks
SwiftUI Study Repository

Made this repository in order to record my progress in my SwiftUI studies.
While reading Apple's official documentation, I discovered some exercise projects and decided to go step by step, as a way to review and practice my code skills.
However, unlike the original project, I will probably make some modifications to suit my personal preferences, or simply how I better understand the code.
